1. How to use:
	1. clone the repo into ex:glitch.com
	2. make your project private so no one steals your cookie
	3. open a private browser window and connect to bot accont
	4. get the cookie named : ".ROBLOSECURITY"
	5. close the private window without logging out
	6. paste it into server.py[line:5]
	7. Optional: put your group id in server.py[line:6]
	8.
		1. if you are not using glitch type the command in terminal "sh start.sh"
		2. after library installing  complete bot should be prepared
